# BreachOps-Config

> [!NOTE]
>
> For now this is just a quick little project, that i started so i can easily manage my own dotfiles without external
> apps.
>
> This is currently only really of use to me, but i thought i would share it so if, on the off chance, it can help
> someone then they can utilize it.
>
> I am also publishing it as i feel it could, later down the line, be turned into something actually useful. Even if
> this does not end up being the case, there is no harm in doing so.

> Hope you enjoy, this repo! :purple_heart::blush::purple_heart:
